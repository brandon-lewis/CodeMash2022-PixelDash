# Build Your First 2D Game with Godot - CodeMash 2022

Listed below are the required tools and art assets required to attend this session.

## 1) Download Godot
Download Godot for free at: https://godotengine.org/download

SourceForge Mirror: https://sourceforge.net/projects/godot-engine.mirror/

Godot is also available on Steam (not recommended due to automatic Major version updates and shift+tab causing Steam overlay, but worth pointing out as an option)

## 2) Download visual and audio Assets
This repo contains an ArtAssets and AudioAssets folder, each containing some zip files for the sounds and graphics that we will be using to create our game. All assets are CC0 and totally free to use.

For your reference, the resources.txt file at the root of this repo contains links to itch.io where each asset was downloaded.
