# Build Your First 2D Game with Godot - CodeMash 2022

Listed below are the required tools and art assets required to attend this session.

Once you've downloaded Godot and the art assets, you are ready to go! There are no additional build steps or setup requirements beyond downloading.

## 1) Download Godot
Download Godot for free at: https://godotengine.org/download

SourceForge Mirror (a backup in case the Godot website is inaccessible): https://sourceforge.net/projects/godot-engine.mirror/

Godot is also available on Steam. This is not recommended as Steam may push automatic Major version updates, and some commonly-used shortcuts may trigger the Steam overlay. Even so, it's worth pointing out that the engine is avaiable on Steam.

## 2) Download visual and audio Assets
This repo contains an ArtAssets and AudioAssets folder, each containing some zip files for the sounds and graphics that we will be using to create our game. All assets are CC0 and totally free to use.

For your reference, the resources.txt file at the root of this repo contains links to itch.io where each asset was downloaded.
